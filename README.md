# The New Boston API
This project was created following the series
[Spring Boot with Kotlin & JUnit 5](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGDPsneZWaOFg0H2wsundyGr) on YouTube,
from [thenewboston channel](https://www.youtube.com/@thenewboston), in order to study Spring Boot. Besides of following
the tutorial as it is, I'm going to implement some own ideas as:
- [ ] Health Check route
- [ ] Simple API documentation, without making usage of any library (using pure HTML and CSS, just to it easy)
- [ ] Integration with real database (once in the tutorial it's only used mocked data)

## 🏗 This project is under build, so not all features are implemented, neither the documentation is complete 🏗
